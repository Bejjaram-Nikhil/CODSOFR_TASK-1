# CODSOFT_TASK-1

🤖 Chatster - Simple Python Chatbot which respond based on pre-defined rules
This is Task 1 of my CodSoft Internship, where I've created a basic text-based chatbot in Python named Chatster. It can understand and respond to simple user inputs using predefined phrases, and even greets you based on the time of day.

💡 Features
=> Time-based greeting (Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening)
=> Responds to common phrases like:
=> "hi", "how are you", "what's your name", "do you like music", etc.
=> Friendly emoji-filled responses
=> Simple and clean command-line interface

🛠️ Tech Used
-> Python 3
-> Built-in datetime module (for time-based greeting)
